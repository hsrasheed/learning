# Probability and Statistics Notes

[Course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE210x+3T2017/)

Doing an experiment summing k random numbers

* Sk = x1 + x2 + ... + xk
* xi = -1 with probability 1/2 and xi = 1 with probability 1/2
* Sk is usually in the range [-4sqrt(k),+4sqrt(k)]
* if k -> infinity, 4/sqrt(k) -> 0
* Sk/k -> 0

* **Probability theory** is proving precisely statements such as the ones made above. It computes probabilities of complex events given the underlying base probabilities.

* Statistics:
    * we are given data that was generated by a stochastic process
    * from that data we infer properties of that stochastic process
