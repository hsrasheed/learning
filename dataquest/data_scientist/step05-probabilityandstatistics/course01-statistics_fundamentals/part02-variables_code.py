# Simple activity on real limits and intervals

# Find the real limits for five values of the BMI (body mass index) variable.

#    We've already extracted the first five BMI values in the data set and rounded each off to a precision of three decimal places. We stored the values as dictionary keys in a dictionary named bmi.
#    For every BMI value write its real limits in a list and make the list a dictionary value that should correspond to the right dictionary key. The lower real limits should come first in each list. For example:

 bmi = {21.201: [21.2005, 21.2015],
 21.329: [21.3285,21.3295],
 23.875: [23.8745,23.8755],
 24.543: [24.5425,24.5435],
 25.469: [25.4685,25.4695]}
