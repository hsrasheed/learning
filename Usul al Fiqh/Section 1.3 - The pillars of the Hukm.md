### 1.3.1 Hukm
### 1.3.2 Haakim

### 1.3.3 Mahkoom 'Alayhi

#### 1.3.3.1 Takleef of the one who lost concentration, forgot, heedless, intoxicated

- These people have no aql and are not spoken to regarding the ahkam of takleef

### 1.3.3.2 Takleef to the non-existant pg 247
- Yes, it occurred and is possible
- Evidence:
	- The command isnt connected to the entities, its connected to a request for some act to be performed
	- And the act must be non existant for it to be performed
	- Only necessary that the doer be a known entity at the time that the act is to be performed (not necessarily when the command is given)

### 1.3.3.3 Takleef with what is impossible

- Op 1 (attributed to Abul Hasan al-Ashari): yes
- Chosen opinion: its impossible
	- A request requires that there is a requested action which can be conceptualized in the mind of the individual (al-talab al-nafsi)
	- Something that has no reality could not be imagined to be conceptualized in the mind of the person
	- The impossible has no reality to it
	- A request can only form in someones mind if they have knowledge about that thing - and something that cannot be known could not have a request for it conceptualized in someones mind
- Q: (Another ishkal around qudrah al-hadithah) ...
- Q: Isnt requesting something in a state of inability giving moral responsibility beyond ones ability? 
- A: The command is issued in a state of ajz, but the command itself is to perform something in the state of ability
- Evidence for Op1: Allah made Abu Jahl responsible for believing in the prophet, and one of the things that he informed about was that Abu Jahl would never believe - so he was asked to believe that he would never believe
- Response: 
	- We've already explained the daleel al-aqli, and that daleel al-shari could never contradict it
	- Abu Jahl was responsible for Iman in Allah and His messenger. Allah informed His messenger that Abu Jahl would never believe. Abu Jahl wasnt made responsible for believing that second piece of information
- Q: Is it possible for there to be a situation with no hukm. 
	- Ex: the person in a usurped farm who harms the owner if he stays and harms the owner if he leaves. 
	- Ex: the person who has fallen on a child and is surrounded by other children - if he stays, he kills the child and if he leaves, he kills the children around him.
- A: Its possible to say that there is no hukm from Allah in these situations, because the hukm is known from a text or qiyas. But because these scenarios are without precedent or similarity, they have no nass or qiyas.
### 1.3.3.4 Q: Does compulsion negate legal responsibility?
- Maj: No The compelled person still has some choice
- Mu'tazilah: Yes, compulsion negates legal responsibility because. The only thing he can do is what he is being compelled to do, and the choice no longer remains for him

### Q: Are the kuffar responsible for the Furoo of shariah?
* Agreement:
	* Kuffar are addressed with the *usul* of the shariah
* Abu Hanifah: No
* Majority: Yes, they are addressed with the furoo as well. There are two issues: the logical possibility, and the legal occurence
* Takleef is based on two things:
	* Aql - understanding the address
	* Qudrah - ability
* Logical Possibility:
	* The disbeliever is among those whose acts are tied to takleef - the same attributes which make takleef possible for others are found in him, and disbelief does not remove that, nor does it change any of the attributes which enable someone to understand the address, or his ability to perform what is being requested
* Q: How is it possible to make him responsible for what is impossible for him to perform? Similarly, the person in a state of hadath could not be imagined to perform salah.
* A: It is not being requested that they do those things which, in order to be valid, require as a precondition that he leaves the state of disbelief while he is still a disbeliever. Its being requested that he does those things *after* satisfying the conditions. Similarly with the person in a a state of minor ritual impurity.
	* Otherwise that objection would lead to a situation where the person who left salah all of their life would only be accountable for not performing wudu - and not for leaving the actual performance of the salah - which is against ijma
* Legal Occurrence:
	* #1 There is ijma that the disbeliever is responsible for believing in the messenger and will be held to account for denying him
	* #2 The ayaat in Surah al-Mudathir - clarifies that they are punished for (along with disbelief) for leaving salah
