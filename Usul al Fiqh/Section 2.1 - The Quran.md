* The nature of the book: It is the speech of Allah which is a sifah of His thaat and which Allah made the text which indicates the miraculousness of Prophet Muhammad. In itself it is a single meaning, it is khabar and istikhbar, it is promise and warning, command and prohibition, etc; there is no repetition in it, but it only differs based on what it is connected to. Whereas the internal speech of the hadith has repetition. The word "speech" is a homonyn that indicates the meaning present in the self pre-eternal or created
* The definition of the book: "What is conveyed to us between the covers of the mushaf, upon the seven ahruf, through mutawatir"

## Section 2.1.3 The phrases (alFaadh) of the book
### The ruling on shath qira'aat
* Issue: The use of shath qira'aat (From footnotes by Thana al Halabi):
	* The seven Qira'aat are mutawaatir by ijma: Abu Amr, Nafi, Asim, Hamzah, Kisa'i, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Aamir
	* The three additional (Yaqub, Abi Jafar, Khalaf) are differed upon, with the majority saying they are also mutawatir
	* Other than those ten, they are shathah.
	* The scholars differed whether qira'at shatha can be used as evidence
		* Malik, Shafi'i - No. Because the prophet was responsible to narrate the Quran that came down to a group, such that their statement could be a decisive evidence. Such a group, we could not imagine they agreeing not to narrate what they heard from him. So if someone is narrating it as Quran and by himself, its a mistake. And if he does not ascribe it as Quran, it could be considered as a narration from the prophet, or considered as his opinion.
		* Hanafi, Hanbali - Yes, they are a zhanni hujjah and should be acted upon from the perspective that they are a khabar ahad, not Quran. So they obligated the fasting of the kaffarah to be on successive days given that we would not question the adalah of ibn masood and the fact that he heard it from the prophet.
		* Zarkashi: qira'at shathah would either be considered hukm or tafseer. If they are tafseer, then they are a hujjah. If they are a hukm, they could either be opposed by another daleel or not. If so, they the daleel should be followed.
### The ruling on the basmalah
* Shafi'i - the basmalah is an ayah of al fatihah and every surah. Based on the fact that its written with the Quran in the same script, by the order of the Prophet and the ijma of the sahabah. The sahabah refused that anything that was not Quran be written with it. To the point that they did not want the dots or the marks of irab written.
* Majority: The basmalah isnt an ayah of the Fatihah or any surah. Evidence: The ijma of the qurra that the person who recites the Quran from the beginning to the end and doesnt separate the surahs with the basmalah has still recited the entire Quran. Some of the qurran separate and some dont, but even those who do, acknowledge that those who dont have recited the Quran completely
### The Qurans containing haqiqah and majaz
- Majaz is a lafdh that is used for other than what is was originally coined for
- "And ask the town..."
- "A wall which wanted to collapse.."
- "Allah is the light of the heavens and earth..."
### The Quran containing non Arabic words
- Op 1 (Majority): The Quran is all Arabic - "the tongue of the one they indicate is non-Arabic and this is a clear Arabic tongue"; "and if we made it a non-Arabic recital, they would have said why arent its verses clarified - its not Arabic, while he is?" And its containing one or two non Arabic words does not remove it from being Arabic (Mishkat, Istabraq)
- Op 2 (Ghazali and others): The Quran contains words from other languages 
### The Muhkam and Mutashabih
- Muhkam - what indicates its meaning, either in  a way that leads to/indicates the (correct) possibility or in a way that clarifies one of two possibilities and leads to/indicates on an interpretation
- Mutashabih - what does not clarify what is intended, such as homonyms (Qur' being both hayd and tuhr, "The in whose hand is the contract of marriage" being both the wali and the husband)
- Q: What about the huruf muqatta'ah? The most popular opinion is that they are the names of the surahs
- Q: ...

## The Ahkam of the Quran
- Mainly dealt with in coming sections (The third part on deriving rulings and the section on naskh)
## Section 2.1.5 Naskh (pg 371)
### Part 1: Definition of Naskh
* Definition: (Ibn Rasheeq)  “Cutting off the continuation of the moral responsibility of the responsible person for the dictates of the first speech, because of a legal evidence that has independent transmission”
* Definition: (scholars of fiqh) "It is the second statement which reveals the time period of the ibadah, or the time when the ibadah will be discontinued.”
#### Affirming it against the deniers
- Agreement that shariah of Muhammad abrogated previous shariahs
#### Permissibility of a command being abrogated before its being possible to implement

**Those who affirmed the possibility of naskh before fulfillment of the command**

Examples of abrogation before the fulfillment of the command:

1. Allah gives a command in Ramadan to make Hajj this year, but then before the day of Arafah commands to not make hajj
2. Allah gives the command for someone to slaughter their son. So the person prepares to fulfill the command, but before performing the slaughter they are commanded not to slaughter their son.

- Example: The story of Ibrahim being commanded to slaughter his son (Ibn Rashiq) 
- Logical argument:
	- Requesting an action before creating the ability is not impossible if the requested act is from the same type (jins) as what the lawgiver has created the ability to perform
	- Qudrah (ability) comes with the maqdoor (the act to be performed) – it cannot precede it, because Qudrah is an `arad (quality) and qualities cannot exist on their own`
	- The request (talab) must precede the act (fil)

**Those who denied the possibility of naskh before fulfillment of the command**

Abul-Husayn (from the Mutazilah) divides the issue of abrogation of a command before its performance into two types:

1. Abrogation of a command after its time has finished – this is allowed because a similar action could possibly become corruption in the future. And if something becomes corruption in the future, it could be prohibited. And then it could be clarified that the command does not include that action.
2. Abrogation of a command before its time has finished – He claims that this is not allowed according to the Mu'tazilah, but also from some of the Hanafis and Shafiis, while some of the scholars of jurisprudence deemed this possible. His evidence was that if Allah commanded us in the morning time to pray two rakahs at sunset, in a state of purity, but then at noon time prohibited us from doing so, it would entail the command and the prohibition encompassing the same act, in the same way, at the same time. That would be an evidence for either badaa’ or the intent to command that which is qabeeh and prohibit that which is husn.

Ibn Rashiq addresses this as the first doubt to be raised under this issue. He responds that the command and the prohibition (or the nasikh and mansookh) are not operative at the same time – the mansookh is operative until the nasikh is affirmed, and then the rulings from the mansookh come to an end.

* Additions to the text
* Abrogation with and without replacement
* Abrogation with the more difficult and the easier
* Abrogation for the one who didnt receive the abrogating text
### Part 2: The Pillars of Naskh and its conditions
* Every hukm in the shariah is susceptible to naskh
#### Abrogation of the hukm but not recitation and vice versa

There are four forms of naskh based on the removal of the recitation, the ruling, or both:

1.       The removal of the recitation and the ruling
2.       The removal of the recitation but not the ruling
3.       The removal of the ruling but not the recitation
4.       The removal of neither the ruling nor the recitation

####  Abrogration of the sunnah by the Quran and vice versa, Abgrogation of the sunnah by the sunnah

The majority of scholars hold that sources which are definitive in their attribution (_qati` al-thuboot_ – the Quran and sunnah mutawatirah) cannot be abrogated by those which are speculative (_zhanni al-thuboot_ – ahad narrations).

The Hanafis, however, accepted the abrogation of the Quran or sunnah mutawatirah by sunnah ahaad. They used as evidence the action of the people of Quba who changed the direction of their prayer whilst praying based on a singular report. The majority responded to this by saying that it was a singular example which could not be used as a basis for other rulings. In addition they raised the possibility that it was the Prophet himself that informed the people of Quba, or that the person informing them had some special indicator that led them to believe him.

* No abrogation based on Ijma
* Qiyas is not abrogated by a text
* The statement of a companion "this ruling was abrogated"
* Clarifying how the delay of the abrogator is known

#### Summary Pillars, Conditions and Forms of Naskh

there are three pillars of abrogation:

1. The abrogator (_naasikh_) – Allah
2. The one for whom the ruling is abrogated (al mansookh anhu) – the morally responsible person
3. The thing with which the abrogation is performed (al mansookh bihi) – the evidence through which naskh is known because of its occurrence

The conditions of naskh are listed as follows:

1. The abrogated ruling must be a hukm shar'i
2. The abrogation must occur via an address from the lawgiver
3. The abrogating ruling must occur after the first evidence (mansookh) is established
