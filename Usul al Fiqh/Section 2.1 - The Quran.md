* The nature of the book: It is the speech of Allah which is a sifah of His thaat and which Allah made the text which indicates the miraculousness of Prophet Muhammad. In itself it is a single meaning, it is khabar and istikhbar, it is promise and warning, command and prohibition, etc; there is no repetition in it, but it only differs based on what it is connected to. Whereas the internal speech of the hadith has repetition. The word "speech" is a homonyn that indicates the meaning present in the self pre-eternal or created
* The definition of the book: "What is conveyed to us between the covers of the mushaf, upon the seven ahruf, through mutawatir"

## Section 2.1.3 The phrases of the book
### The ruling on shath qira'aat
* Issue: The use of shath qira'aat (From footnotes by Thana al Halabi):
	* The seven Qira'aat are mutawaatir by ijma: Abu Amr, Nafi, Asim, Hamzah, Kisa'i, Ibn Kathir, Ibn Aamir
	* The three additional (Yaqub, Abi Jafar, Khalaf) are differed upon, with the majority saying they are also mutawatir
	* Other than those ten, they are shathah.
	* The scholars differed whether qira'at shatha can be used as evidence
		* Malik, Shafi'i - No. Because the prophet was responsible to narrate the Quran that came down to a group, such that their statement could be a decisive evidence. Such a group, we could not imagine they agreeing not to narrate what they heard from him. So if someone is narrating it as Quran and by himself, its a mistake. And if he does not ascribe it as Quran, it could be considered as a narration from the prophet, or considered as his opinion.
		* So for this reason, they differed with the opinion stating the obligation of someone fasting the days for kaffarah successively as is narrated in the Qira'ah of ibn Masood
		* Qira'at shatha should not be considered a hujjah and they should not have the hukm of a khabar from the prophet, because the one narrating it never said that it was Quran (which is necessarily mutawatir). If it cant be affirmed as Quran, it cant be affirmed as a khabar.
		* Hanafi, Hanbali - Yes, they are a zhanni hujjah and should be acted upon from the perspective that they are a khabar ahad, not Quran. So they obligated the fasting of the kaffarah to be on successive days given that we would not question the adalah of ibn masood and the fact that he heard it from the prophet.
		* Zarkashi: qira'at shathah would either be considered hukm or tafseer. If they are tafseer, then they are a hujjah. If they are a hukm, they could either be opposed by another daleel or not. If so, they the daleel should be followed.
### The ruling on the basmalah
* Shafi'i - the basmalah is an ayah of al fatihah and every surah. Based on the fact that its written with the Quran in the same script, by the order of the Prophet and the ijma of the sahabah. The sahabah refused that anything that was not Quran be written with it. To the point that they did not want the dots or the marks of irab written.
* Majority: The basmalah isnt an ayah of the Fatihah or any surah. Evidence: The ijma of the qurra that the person who recites the Quran from the beginning to the end and doesnt separate the surahs with the basmalah has still recited the entire Quran. Some of the qurran separate and some dont, but even those who do, acknowledge that those who dont have recited the Quran completely
### The Qurans containing haqiqah and majaz
- Majaz is a lafdh that is used for other than what is was originally coined for
- "And ask the town..."
- "A wall which wanted to collapse.."
- "Allah is the light of the heavens and earth..."
### The Quran containing non Arabic words
- Op 1 (Majority): The Quran is all Arabic - "the tongue of the one they indicate is non-Arabic and this is a clear Arabic tongue"; "and if we made it a non-Arabic recital, they would have said why arent its verses clarified - its not Arabic, while he is?" And its containing one or two non Arabic words does not remove it from being Arabic (Mishkat, Istabraq)
- Op 2 (Ghazali and others): The Quran contains words from other languages 
### The Muhkam and Mutashabih
- Muhkam - what indicates its meaning, either in  a way that leads to/indicates the (correct) possibility or in a way that clarifies one of two possibilities and leads to/indicates on an interpretation
- Mutashabih - what does not clarify what is intended, such as homonyms (Qur' being both hayd and tuhr, "The in whose hand is the contract of marriage" being both the wali and the husband)
- Q: What about the huruf muqatta'ah? The most popular opinion is that they are the names of the surahs
- Q: ...
