## Types of Istishab:
1. Type 1
	1. (Ibn Rashiq) The absence of responsibility before the coming of revelation, 
	2. (Ibn Al Qayyim) The persistence of that which is established remaining established and that which is negated remaining negated 
	3. (Zarkashi) What is established in a past time by default remains in the future.
2. Type 2 - Persistence of the generality until a specifier is conveyed; persistence of an evidence until an abrogator is conveyed
3. Type 3 - Persistence of the rulings of sale, marriage, and the workings of subjugation?? (shuglu thimmah) with the presence of their causes until something changes that
4. Type 4 - Persistence of ijma on an issue of difference (not correct)
## Issue: Persitence (Istishab) al-Ijma on issues of khilaf
* Op 1: (Malik and Shafi'i) A ruling on which there is ijma persists, takes precedence and carries forward into an area where there is a difference of opinion. 
	* Example: The person who made tayammum, if they see water during their prayer, continues with their prayer - there is ijma on the correctness of the prayer and its persistence. So the tarayan of finding water is like the blowing of the wind, or the coming of fajr, or other events that occur during prayer
* Op 2: (Abu Hanifah) There is no istishab of ijma on issues of khilaf
	* The example is invalid, because the ijma is only on the validity of prayer with tayammum in the absence of water. If this was an issue of ijma, then the person differeing with it would be going against that
## Issue: Does the person negating something have to bring an evidence?
* Op 1: Yes (Ibn Rashiq). Negation is a claim, and any claim could be true or false
* Op 2: No. For two reasons:
	* The defendant does not have to give a proof because he is negating - only the claimant is required to give evidence
		* Response: The defendants denials isnt accepted without evidence - at least they must swear
	* Its impossible to give proof negating something, like establishing bara'ah al-thimmah
		* Response: For aqliyat its possible to establish proof, such as it leading to that which is impossible. For shariyat its possible to show abrogating evidences to prove nafiy after thuboot, before thuboot one can use the lack of evidences, or ijma
* Op 3: It depends on whether its in aqliyaat or shariyaat
## Section: Things which people think are evidences, but they arent
### First: The shariah of previous nations as an evidence
* Its logical possibility - its possible for Allah to give takleef with whatever he wishes of previous revelation
* Its actual occurrence -
* Op 1: there are common things from previous revelations through which we worship Allah, but we know about all of those things based on instruction by the Prophet, not on the tongue of any of the previous prophets
		* Evidence 1: Its not narrated that the prophet returned to the tawrah or injil seeking their ruling on something
		* Evidence 2: In order for us to refer to those revelations, it would have been required for us to narrate them as we narrate the quran and sunnah, and it would have been required for the sahabah to return to that source on rulings that were difficult for them to ascertain
* Op 2: There are a number of ayaat that refer to following the huda (guidance) of previous prophets, millah (way) 
* Response: these refer to tawheed and are directed at the prophet respectively). Or refer to the tawrah has having huda and noor (but is open to interpretation). There are also a few hadith cited which are not conclusive
### Second: The statement of a companion
* Op1: The mathab of a sahabi is an absolute evidence (hujjatun mutlaqan)
* Op 2: The mathab of a sahabi is an evidence if it differs from qiyas
* Op 3: The opinions of only Abu Bakr and Umar are evidences
	* Proof: "Follow the two after me: Abu Bakr and Umar" (Abu Ya'la, Ahmad, Tirmidhi, Ibn majah)
* Op 4: The agreements of the khualafa al-rashideen are an evidence when they agree
	* Agreement: The opinions of the sahaba are not an evidence against other mujtahids among the sahabah
	* Difference: Are the opinions of the mujtahids among the sahaba an evidence for later mujtahids?
		* Op1: Yes - M, Sh (qadeem), Muhammad ibn Hasan, Hb
		* Op2: No - Majority
* Op 5 (Ibn Rasheeq) - The statement or opinion of a sahabi is not an evidence in any way
* Proofs for Opinion 5
	* Evidence 1: Their agreement on the permissibility of differing with each other - if the statement of each one of them was an evidence for the rest of the ummah, they would not have allowed differing amongst themselves. And just as its permissible for them to differ amongst themselves, its permissible for others to differ with them.
	* Evidence 2: Its possible for any of them to have erred. How could it be possible to resort to their opinions (rujoo' elayh)
	* Evidence 3: The obligation of following is only affirmed for the one for whom infallibility is established
* Objection: The obligation of following them is based on it being an act of worship - so ismah and salamah min al khata are not conditions. The same way, when its obligatory to act on a hadith, its not necessary for it to be free of errors
	* Evidences: "My companions are like stars, anyone of them you follow, you will be guided", "I enjoin you to follow my sunnah and the sunnah of the khulafa al-rashideen" (the four except nasa'i), Abdul-Rahman ibn Awfs giving bay'ah to Uthman on the condition of him following Abu Bakr and Umar, If the permissibility of following them was connected to some certain evidence, the sahabah would have disapproved of this, because this is like establishing a principle and the shariah which requires a certain evidence 
* Response: 
	1. All of the evidences cited are ahaad narrations which cant be used to affirm issues of usul
	2. These hadith require interpretation, but efforts at interpretation (of these hadith) come away without a clear preference for the correct one, because the person doing the following is general and not specified - it could be directed at the general person who didnt reach the level of ijtihad, in which case the benefit of the second narration is dropping the obligation of searching for the most knowledgable. 
	3. As for Abdul Rahman ibn Awf, its possible that Uthman responded in that way because the opinions of Abu Bakr and Umar agreed with his own, not because he would make taqleed of them
* Objection: The sahaba are more knowledageble about the statements of the prophet, their observations of his states, and his gestures, so their fatwa may differ from qiyas but it should not be construed as them giving fatwa based on desire. And in those cases they should be followed.
* Response: If a sahabi reported something about the prophet then he must act upon it. If he acts upon it, then it shows that what he narrated is a proof according to him. But that does not extend to others.
* Objection: If its not obligatory to make taqleed of the sahaba, is it at least permissible?
* Response: Its permissible for the general person. As the for the scholar:
	* Generally its haraam for him to make taqleed of another scholar
	* Shafi'i (qadeem) - its allowable to make taqleed of a sahabi if their statement is widely known and not contradicted
	* Shafi'i (jadeed) - its not permissible to make taqleed of a sahabi
* Objection: Can the opinion of a sahabi be used to make tarjeeh between two opinions based on qiyas?
* Response: No
### Third: Istihsaan
### The meanings of Istihsaan
1. What a mujtahid thinks is best without reference to a shari daleel
2. An evidence which the mujtahid feels certain about within himself, but is unable to explain why
3. A statement with evidence:
	1. Transferring a mas'alah to something similar among the specific evidences in the Quran
	2. Transferring a mas'alah to something similar among the specific evidences in the Sunnah
* Ibn Rasheeq: 
	* The first is making a statement without evidence which is tahakkum (ruling based on desire). Allahs rulings that entail takleef cannot be affirmed without evidence
	* The second meaning is impossible because it entails that an evidence appropriate to be used becoming inexpressible within the mind of the mujtahid, when all shar'i evidences can be expressed (nass, ijma, or qiyas). If it cant be expressed, its not knowable. Whats not knowable isnt appropriate to used as a basis for judging
	* The third is ruling based on an evidence - calling it istihsan is just a mistake
* Objection: The Prophet said "What the Muslims deem as good is good with Allah"
* Response: The intent of this is ijma
* Objection: The Muslims have regarded as good a number of things like entering public baths without paying a fixed price, or having a set period for stayin
* Response: Usually the price paid is greater that what is needed, which is something recommended in the shariah
### Fourth: Istislaah
* Meaning: Preserving the intents of the shariah in the takleef of the servants. The overall intent is the preservation of the nafs, deen, aql, nasl and maal. Anything that leads to preserving one of these five is a maslahah - anything that opposes one of them is a mafsadah.
* (Dr. Zuhayli) Attributes which fit the maqasid of the shariah, but which are not 'witnessed' by a specific daleel of the shariah to affirm or deny it. And when a hukm is tied with it a benefit is achieved or a harm is repelled.
* The benefit (maslahah) from the perspective of the shariah falls into three categories:
	* Those which the shariah mention/witnesses/acknowledges to validate it
		* Ex: qiyas - it necessitates action because it is the extraction of rulings from the understanding of a text or ijma
	* Those which the shariah mention/witnesses to invalidate it
		* Ex: The case of a scholar who necessitated fasting as kaffarah (rather than paying) for the one who had intercourse during the day in ramadan, with the logic that if the king were allowed to free a slave, the kaffarah would be too easy for him
	* Those which the shariah does not mention/witnesses -- neither to validate or invalidate it (this type is the subject of the further discussion)
* The maslahah regarding its strength/level is divided into three categories
	* Darooraat - Necessities
		* Ex: Obligation of Qisas because it preserves life (nafs)
		* Ex: Killing the disbeliever who misguides others, the innovator because it preserves religion (deen)
		* Ex: The hadd for zina, because it preserves lineage (nasl)
		* Ex: The punishment for the usurper and theif, because they preserve wealth (maal)
		* Ex: The prohibition of intoxicants and the hadd for the one who consumes them because of the preservation of aql (intellect)
		* There are also things that take the same ruling as the above because they have a role in completing, for example the condition of equality and likeness in qisas, because it brings about healing; or the prohibition of drinking even a little intoxicant,because it leads to larger amounts. These are at a lower level, so its possible that the shariah differs about them
	* Haajaat - Needs
		* Ex: The disposition of the wali for the affairs of marriage for the immature boy or girl
	* Tahseenaat - Good things
		* Ex: Conditioning the wali for the validity of the marriage contract
	* Tazyeenaat - Beautifiers
