## 4.3.0 Introductory matters

### 4.3.0.1 - The ordering of evidences
- The first thing the researcher should look for is whether or not there is ijma' on a certain issue - even if it apparently goes against a text of the Quran or sunnah
- This is because that ijma which contradicts a text indicates abrogration - and the ummah does not gather on error
- If there is no ijma and he finds a text of the Quran or mutawatir sunnah, he may follow whichever he desires
- If two texts of the Quran and Sunnah contradict he must select which one is the later that will abrogate the earlier
- Then he should look to the generalities ('umoomaat') of the Book and Sunnah and the specifiers (mukhassisat) 
- Then he should look to things related to the actions of the Prophet and their levels

### 4.3.0.2 The reality of contradiction and juristic preference

- Texts which oppose each other are in conflict and this happens when there is no possibility of reconciliation and that occurs with texts in which abrogation is possible
- If the outer meanings contradict, this could be resolved by interpretation or prefering one text over another
- Its impossible that two texts actually contradict and one of them does not abrogate the other
- Its impossible that Allah ?reveal? two texts ('illahs) both definitive and contradictory which a secondary ruling revolves around while requiring analogy be performed between them
### 4.3.0.3 Obligation of Tarjeeh
- Its obligatory to make tarjeeh and follow the arjah based on the ijma of the sahaba

## 4.3.1 How narrations are preferred

- Khabar - what is derived from the narrators regarding the hadith of ahkam
- Preferring a narration:
1. One hadith is free from ikhtilaf and idtirab
2. One of the hadiths has idtirab in the isnad - the names of the narrators are confused with weak narrators, such that its difficult to distinguish between them. This is actually not tarjeeh, because its obligatory to take out hadiths like this due to the unknown status of some of these narrators
3. For one person to narrate something contradictory in a story well known to the scholars of hadith
4. One of the narrators narrates something well known with an addition ?? but the other narrator has stronger hifdh
5. One narrator says "I heard" while the other says "It was written to me"
6. One of the narrations is mawquf and the other is marfu
7. One of the narrators was involved in the event (sahib al-waqi'ah)
8. One of the narrators is more upright (aadil), precise (dabit), more aware (yaqazhah)
9. One of the narrations agrees with the connected practice of the people of madinah
10. The ummah practices one of the narrations
11. One of the narrations is more specific (preferred) and the other more general
12. One of the narrations has independent dalalah without any need of hiddenness, while the other narrations is subject to some hiddeness that must be uncovered

### 4.3.2 Preference of legal causes
- Preference between legal causes depends on:
	- affirming the hukm
	- the presence of the hukm in the asl
	- the establishment of an evidence about its correctness
	- the realization of its presence in the secondary case (al-far`)
1. If the hukm is established by a qati' evidence (in the asl?) and then the illah in the secondary case is contradicted by a hukm established by a zhanni evidence, then the .... ?
2. The presence of the illah in the asl - is it ma'loom (certain) or mazhnoon (speculative)
	1. Ex: is the prohibition of khamr due to intoxication or due to its being najas - the first is ma'lool, the second is mazhnoon
3. The presence of an evidence establishing its correctness. The illah whose effect is established by a mutawatir evidence or ijma is prefered over an illah whose effect is established by something ahad
4. The presence of the illah in the far - is it maloom or mazhnoon
5. One of the two illahs contains the hikmah behind the hukm
6. Some also prefered an illah based on the statement of a sahabi, or if one of the illahs agrees with something that is widely narrated
7. Others gave preference to the illah that is muta'addiyah (can be applied to  other situations) vs the one that is qasirah (only applied to that one situation)
