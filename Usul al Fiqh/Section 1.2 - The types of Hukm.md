### 1.2.1 Divisions of Hukm
- الواجب - الفعل تغلق به خطاب الإيجاب
- محظور/حرام - فعل الذي تعلق خطاب الحظر بتركه
- ندب - فعل الذي تعلق به خطاب الندب
- المكروه - ما تعلق به خطاب الكراهة
- المباح - الذي خير الشرع بين فعله و تركه من غير ترجيح لأحدهما على الآخر

### 1.2.2 Types of Wajib wrt performance of a specific act
- Muayyan
- wajib mukhayyar - unspecified between mentioned categories
- Q: is Wajib negated by there being a choice?
- A: No, evidence: its occurrence with the options for Kaffarah

### 1.2.3 Types of Wajib wrt time
- Mudayyiq
	- Ex: Fasting of Ramadan
- Muwassi
	- Ex: Obligatory prayers

### 1.2.4 Is anything required to complete a wajib also wajib?
- The mas'alah should be reworded to say "Is something which is ordinarily needed to complete a wajib, but is not automatically included in the act itself also wajib"
- Maj: Yes
- Ibn Rashiq: Whatever is needed to complete a wajib, the mukallaf should not be prevented from doing it. But it is not also obligatory
- Evidence:

### 1.2.5 If a hukm of wujoob is lifted, what is left? Jawaz?

- If a hukm of wajib is lifted, there is no hukm - it takes the ruling of "acts before the coming of revelation"

### 1.2.6 Is the mubah commanded?
- No

### 1.2.7 Is the Mandoob commanded? pg 55
- Yes - Command is a request, and the mandoob is requested

### 1.2.8 & 1.2.9 Q: Can the same act be both commanded and prohibited?
- At first glance this implies a contradiction
- A "single act" is of two types:
	- Wahid bil-naw - within the single act there are different types included in it.
		- In which case it could be possible that a command is connected to one of its types, while prohibition is connected to another of its types. 
		- Ex: Sujud to Allah vs Sujud to idols
	- Wahid bil-'ayn - a single act that is not a category or general type. But the single act has multiple perspecties
		- It is possible to have a command and prohibition connect to a single act, albeit from different perspectives.
		- Ex: Prayer on usurped land. 
- Q: is the prayer performed on usurped land valid or not?
	- Issue: At the same time the person is performing a commanded prayer, they are also performing the act of usurpation which is prohibited
	- Maj (Hanafis, Malikis, Shafi'es): its valid
		- Although according to this picture, the usurpation and salah are gathered together, they could be separated such that the prayer is performed elsewhere and a different act is performed on the land that was usurped
		- Evidence: Lack of an ijma on the usurper needing to repeat the prayer made in a usurped home
	- Mu'tazilah and some Hanbalis: not valid
		- The usurpation and the salah are interdependent
		- The actions done during the prayer confirm the usurpation and are therefore haram
		- The prayer which is partially haram cannot be wajibah
		- Opinion is based on them deeming the asl and the wasf as equivalent
	- Qadi Abu Bakr: such prayer satisfies the obligation. 
	- Ibn Rashiq - Evidence (that there is no contradiction)
		- The command to pray is connected to the place only because he happens to be praying there - not because of that particular location being specified (ie "pray here"). 
		- There is a difference between saying:
			- "Pray in this location at this time"
			- "Pray at this time"
		- For the first one if they pray in a different place, they havent fulfilled
		- For the second one if they pray in a different place, they have fulfilled the command
		- From the perspective that hes praying, its commanded
		- From the perspectives that he is also usurping, its prohibited

### 1.2.10 Q: What If a nahee is connected to the same thing that a command is, or connected to an attribute of the thing that is commanded?
- Agreement: impossible for amr and nahee to be connected to the same thing
- Connected to a wasf?
	- Abu Hanifah: possible for the prohibition to be connected to a wasf s/t the wasf could be invalidated without voiding the entire act, such as the tawaf of the person in minor ritual impurity or the fasting on the day of eid
	- Majority - The prohibition of the wasf returns to the asl and the entire act is invalid
	- Ibn Rashiq:
		- The prohibition is connected to the two things together (tawaf+hadath, fasting+the day of eid)
		- The prohibition is connected to the tawaf of the muhdith and the fasting on the day of nahr. If we insist on its being commanded despite the prohibition we end up  with a contradiction "Make tawaf"/"Dont make tawaf"
### 1.2.?? Is commanding something the same as prohibiting its opposite

- Agreement: saying "Stand!" is different than saying "Dont sit!"
- The difference is the question: Is it understood from saying "Stand!" that one must *Leave sitting*, as it is understood from "Stand!" that standing is requested
- Majority: Yes commanding something is prohibiting its opposite and prohibiting something is commanding one of its opposites. Based on the fact that the meaning in the mind which is expressed by "Stand!" is the same as the meaning in the mind expressed by "Dont sit!"
- Mu'tazilah: No, the seeghah of amr is different that the seeghah of nahee
- Qadi Abu Bakr: Commanding something includes prohibiting its opposite and entails it.
- Ibn Rashiq *DISSENTING OPINION*: No, cant assume that the person being requested to do something has in their mind the leaving of its opposite. Leaving the opposite is a means for performing the commanded, but its not necessary (lazim)
