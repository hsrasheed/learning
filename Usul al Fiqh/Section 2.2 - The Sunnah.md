## Introduction
### Phrases of Tahammul (receiving the narration)
1. Sami'tu, Haddathanee, Shafahanee
2. Qaala
	1. This phrase is zhaahir in sama'ah, but not certain (could have heard from someone else)
3. "The prophet commanded"
	1. Could indicate the same as the previous phrases, but also carries possibility that someone thought something was a command when it was not
4. "We were commanded"
	1. Could indicate the same as the previous phrases, but adds the additional possibility that someone other than the Prophet did the commanding
	2. Most scholars say, however, that this possibility should be rejected, as the sahaba used that phrase in the context of establishing an evidence so it could only be a command of Allah or His prophet. Carrying the same meaning are phrases like "Its from the sunnah..."
5. "We used to do..." (when attributed to the time of the Prophet)
	1. It is an evidence of the permissibility of the action - usually indicates something he was taught by the prophet and did not disapprove of
## Part 1: Tawatur
- Definition of khabar: a claim which affirms or negates, and could be true, impossible, permissible, or false
### Section 2.2.1 Tawatur leads to certain knowledge
- Proof: our knowledge about about faraway lands and past nations, which no one doubts.
### Section 2.2.2 Conditions for tawatur
1. That the narrators inform based on knowledge, not speculation.
2. That their knowledge is connected to something sensory
3. That the report is connected to a number of people which would make it impossible for all of them to collaborate on a lie
		- For this we return to customary witnessing
		- Its possible that the presence of supporting factors could reduce the needed number of witnesses/reports
		- There are things known with certainty like a person's shyness, fear or anger without being informed of them
4. That all levels of the report are the same in reaching the level of tawatur
5. That it reaches the complete number required
### The number required for tawatur
* With respect to tawatur, number of reporters divided into three types: Kaamil, Naqis and Zaa'id
#### Kaamil
- Defn of Kaamil - the lowest number for achieving tawatur. 
- - Naaqis -  what falls short of the level of tawatur
- - Zaaid - what exceeds the number required for tawatur
- Although its not known, when knowledge is attained its through the complete number required for tawatur. 
- And the same number will lead to knowledge in every case and for every person.
- Its possible that qara'in will support a report at the naaqis level to lead to knowledge
- Also possible that qara'in will take a report at the tawatur level and lower its status to the point that it no longer produces certain knowledge. Ex: The way that rulers use force to control narrations would influence the certainty, even in the presence of tawatur
- Q: Is 4 the number for tawatur?
- A: No, a judge is allowed to use the witness of 4 people, only along with outside endorsement of their uprightness (tazkiyah). If 4 witnesses were sufficient to lead to certain knowledge, the tazkiyah wouldnt be required.
- Q: What about some of the numbers specified by some scholars like 40 (needed for jumuah), 70 (number of people picked by musa), 313 (number of muslims at badr)?
- A: These are all claims with no evidence. And in these cases, there is no evidence that there were even reports passed on to others. These numbers could actually be Zaaid and not Kaamil.
- Q: How can we claim to achievement of knowledge through tawatur, but not know the number of reports it takes to reach that?
- A: the same way we know that bread satiates without knowing the exact amount it takes to achieve that.
- All other conditions which have been suggested, such as tawatur being an unlimited number, or the reporters being from different lineages, being awliya, or not being compelled by force, or being infallible imams - are all false

### Section 2.2.3 Divisions of reports
### Reports known to be true
1. What Allah and His prophet inform about
2. What is narrated by a number of tawatur
3. What the people of ijma narrate to be true
4. Any report that agrees with 1-3
### Reports known to be false
1. Any report contradicted by what is known from the intellect or inspection
2. What contradicts what is known by sensory perception
3. What contradicts a clear text from the Quran, Sunnah or Ijma
4. What contradicts something narrated by tawatur
5. What should have been narrated by a great number of people, but which many were silent about (like historical reports which should be well known but arent. Ex: The amir being killed in the market, or the khateeb being unable to give khutbah)
- Issue: what about issues in Islamic history which should have been narrated by a great number but werent and the narrator wasnt disbelieved?
	- The prophets hajj being Qiran or Ifrad
	- The prophet entering the kabah and praying there
	- The prophet entering makkah by force or by treaty
	- The splitting of the moon
	- The ifrad or tathniyyah of the iqamah
- Response:
	- The first two would only be known to a small number
	- The third is actually well known by force and carrying weapons
	- The fourth would only be witnessed by a small group that had challenged him
	- The fifth: many people hear the iqamah but dont pay attention to the actual words
### Reports where we make tawaqquf
- Everything else that doesnt fall into one of the previous categories.
- Q: If you cant prove truthfulness wouldnt that make it a lie?
- A: This is opposed by the approach that lack of evidence that its a lie indicates its truthfulness (which is from principles of hadith)
## Part 2: Akhbar Ahad (450-)
### Section 2.2.4 Affirming it against the deniers
- Defn: What is narrated by one person, or any number that falls short of tawatur, while in the absence of secondary factors (qareenah) that would give certainty about its truthfulness
#### Issue: Evidences for logical possibility, occurence and permissibility of forming the basis of worship
- 1) Based on reports from the seerah that are beyond doubt that he used to send his governors and messengers to different areas conveying rulings, halal and haram, collecting zakat. He would send out expeditions and require its members to follow a single amir
- 2) The ijma of the sahaba on acting based on khabar al wahid, and their explicit statements in different situations
- 3) The layperson, unaware of ijma, is obligated to make taqleed of a mufti. Which is a form of khabar wahid that the ruling of Allah is such and such
- 4) Ayah in surah tawbah: 122 "falaw laa nafara min kulli firqatin minhum taa'ifatun" - and a taa'ifah is less than the number of tawatur 

#### Issue: Obligation of acting upon khabar al wahid is known through aql
- No, its known through revelation (the evidences above)
### Section 2.2.5 Conditions of the narrators and their attributes
#### Conditions of the narrator
- Mukallaf
- Muslim
- Adl
- Dabt

#### Issue: Defining Adalah
- Adl - the steadfastness of the mukallaf inwardly and outwardly on the commands of the shariah, and avoiding what detracts from manliness (muroo'ah) - even if it may be permissible
#### Issue: The disobedient person who gives some interpretation for their act (muta'awwal)
- Op1 (Shafii) - accept their narration and witness
- Op2 (Qadi Abu Bakr, Ibn Rashiq) - dont accept 
	- Allah prohibited accepting the narration of a fasiq (surah al hujuraat) 
	- If adalah is a condition, then once its lost the narration and witness cant be accepted
### Section 2.2.6 Jarh and Ta'deel
#### Issue: Conditioning a certain number to endorse a person for narration and witness (tazkiyah)
- Op1: Tazkiyah of a number of people is  a condition
- Op2: Its not
- Op3 (Ibn Rashiq): Tazkiyah of a number of people is a condition for witness, but not narration - one is sufficient
#### Issue: Mentioning the reason for critiquing a narrator
- Op 1 (Shafii): Must mention reason for critique, but not reason for endorsement
- Op 2: Must mention reason for endorsement, critique generality is sufficient
- Op 3: Must mention reason for both
- Op 4 (Ibn rashiq) If the person critiquing or endorsing knows that they share the same criteria as the person using their critique/endorsement, its not necessary to mention the reason -- otherwise it must be mentioned
#### Issue: What constitutes and endorsement
- An explicit statement - "he is upright", ??"I am content (and mention the reason for adalah if there may be some doubt by stating it generally)"
- Narrating from the person - if it is known that he only narrates from those who are adl, and his method of tadeel is known to be reasonable/customary
- Acting on their narration
- Ruling based on their narration

#### Issue: Trustworthiness of the sahabah
- Evidence: Hadith of the prophet that the ummah would divide into sects and the victorious sect would be "what I and my companions are following"
- Defn of sahabah: anyone who achieved suhbah with the Prophet - even for an hour. But the intent of the praise of the prophet was to include those who had accompanied him extensively, until they were guided by his guidance
### Section 2.2.7 Documenting the narrators receiving what they narrate

1. The shaykh reading to him in a gathering of narration - "haddathanee","akhbaranaa","sami'tu","yukhbiru"
2. Reading to the shaykh while he listens, and then remains silent (as if to say 'thats correct') -- customarily the scholars of hadith would say 'such and such narrated to us through reading'
3. (Ijazah) Permission to narrate  by the shaykh saying 'I give you permission to narrate this book', or 'what you have correctly heard of my statements'
4. (Munawalah 'Gifting') The shaykh saying that he narrates a certain book and that you can narrate it as well - the narrator would then have to specify "such-and-such informed me through his book which he has given me"
