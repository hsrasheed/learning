### 4.2.1 What is the ruling on taqlid

| No. | Description | Held by | Evidences |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The attainment of the truth is through taqlid, and investigation and the seeking evidence is haram. | Mu'tazilah |  |
| 2 | Taqlid is not obligatory | Majority | |

Op1 Evidences:
* The person seeking (mujtahid) is in doubts, and the misguidance of the researchers could be many. So leaving researching and instead seeking safety is preferable
* Allah says that "no one does jidal in the ayaat of Allah except the Kaafir"

Op2 Evidences:
* The existance of ijma between the sahaba and tabieen on seeking rulings from their evidences
* If you obligate taqlid, the person being followed is either a muqallid () or a mujtahid (in which case they would be doing something haram, fisq)

Issue: Obligatory to seek fatwa from a mujtahid that is 1) adl 2) firmly established in the ahkam 3) able to use the adillah. They can be known by witness (shahadah) or riwayah (narration) that gives strong belief

Issue: Do we have to seek the most knowledgeable? Op1 (Hanbalis, some Shafi'is): Yes Op2: No. Previous generations wouldnt require this. Sometimes the most knowledgeable in a particular area isnt known. If fatwas conflict, best to find the most knowledgable

Issue: What should the muqallid do if fatwas conflict and the people are at the same level in knowledge? Op1 (Al-Qadi): Choose whichever they wish. Op2: Its usually not possible for the general person to make tarjeeh of the fatwas.


### 4.2.2 Asking fatwa from the unknown person
- Majority - not allowed to ask for a fatwa from someone whom you dont know their state
- Small minority - allowed it

### 4.2.3 Does someone have to seek the most qualified scholar?
- Majority - No, not obligatory. Earlier generations would not disapprove of someone asking one of them even if there were those more knowledgable. Sometimes the most knowledgable on a certain subject is unknown
- Minority - yes, one has to seek out the most qualified
- Q: If the scholars are equal in knowledge and their fatwas conflict?
	- Al-Qadi: Questioner can choose and then act on whichever fatwa they want
	- Ibn Rashiq: normally not possible for the questioner to know if the scholars are equal in knowledge. If he tries to claim some preference, its based on hawa. If he begins to have the ability to distinguish, then he will become a person who must follow their own opinion, rather than following the person whose fatwa he prefers.
