## 4.1.1 What is ijtihad

Defn: Exerting effort from the one firmly grounded in identifying the rulings of the shariah from its evidences (مظانها) and its proofs, such that there is no effort left

## 4.1.2 The mujtahid and their qualities

1. He should be knowledgable about how to derive the rulings from their evidences

Levels of Ijtihad (Ibn alQayyim) from the notes by ???
1. Mutlaq
2. Muqayyad (restricted) to the mathab that he has chosen. But without making taqlid of its imam: not in hukm or daleel
3. Mujtahid in the mathab he is associated with.??? He cannot go beyond the fatawa of that mathab or differ from them. If he finds the nass of his imam, he does not go beyond him. This is most of those who write in a particular mathab.
4. Mujtahid in the mathab is is associated with.??? He has memorized its fatwas and secondary issues. Makes absolute taqlid

## 4.1.3 The subject of ijtihad

Area: Every hukm shar'i which the mujtahid is ignorant of

- Issue: The permissibility of the Prophet making ijtihad in things where no revelation had come
- Issue: The permissibility of others making ijtihad other than the prophet during his lifetime

## 4.1.4 The principles of ijtihad

### 4.1.4.1 The sinlessness of the mujtahid who exerts his utmost effort

Generally indicated by the ayah:
لا نكلف نفسا إلا وسعها

### 4.1.4.2 The difference regarding the correctness of the mujtahids

Ibn Rashiq's Argument for why every mujtahid isnt correct and those who say Allah doesnt have a hukm are incorrect:

- If a mujtahid is faced with a situation, there are 3 possibilities
	1. He is certain in assigning a certain hukm
	2. He is certain in negating a certain hukm
	3. He is open to the possibility (جوّز) that Allah has a hukm on that matter if he searches - whether he is correct in the end or not

* If 1 or 2, then its impossible for that to be an area of ijtihad
* If 3 then how could one be certain that Allah *does not* have a hukm on that issue
* And why would they pursue a preponderant opinion (غلبة الظن) while being  certain in the negation (of Allah having a hukm)
* That implies affirming uncertainty in that which is known (which is a contradiction) and would make seeking a hukm impossible
* There is ijma' that the mujtahid must search. and its not permissible for him to rush to a fatwa that there is no hukm for Allah in that situation before searching
* If someone has to search, there must be something to search for
* And the thing being searched for cannot be the same level of uncertainty (zhann)

| No. | Description | Held by | Evidences |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | - Every mujtahid is correct. <br>- Allah does not have a specific ruling on issues that are open to ijtihad.<br>- Whenever the mujtahid has a preponderance of opinion, that is Allah's hukm in the matter | Baqillani, Ghazali, Shafi(1), (Majority of mutakallimeen)  |  |
| 2 | - Only one of the mujtahids is correct, but which one is not known<br>- Finding Allah's hukm is the aim of searching and its goal | Abu Hanifa, Malik, Shafi(2), Ahmad |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |


### 4.1.4.3 If the evidences conflict for a mujtahid

| No. | Description | Held by | Evidences |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The mujtahid should make tawaqquf or make taqlid of someone else | Majority of those who said that every mujtahid is correct and those who said that the correct opinion is only one |  |
| 2 | He is free to choice whichever evidence he wants to act upon | Al Qadi al-Baqillani |  |
| 3 | He cannot act on only one of them if they contradict. But he can choose the most cautious (الأحوط) as the specified opinion. | Ibn Rashiq |  |
|  |  |  |  |

Ibn Rashiq's argument
- Its impossible to work with two evidences, or to set responsibilities based on their dictates, otherwise it might lead to giving responsibility for something impossible - it would lead to joining two opposites.
- The only option is that one of them drops from being acted upon and the other is acted upon. But which one is not clear, so it cant be used to dictate takleef because that would entail takleef without a daleel which is impossible

### 4.1.4.4 A mujtahid cannot invalidate their own fatwa

| No. | Description | Held by | Evidences |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | A mufti cannot cancel a fatwa given or a ruling given based on their ijtihad; it would lead to an infinite progression. This is the way the earlier generations approached the issue. |  |  |
| 2 | If he becomes aware of a text that goes again a fatwa made, he must go back to the text and invalidate anything that goes against it | Ijma |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |

- No difference of opinion reported
- A mujtahid cannot invalidate a fatwa that they issued, or a ruling that they gave based on ijtihad
- To do so would be in opposition of the salaf
- Ijma: If a nass becomes apparent that contradicts the fatwa given, or the ruling that was given based on ijtihad, then he should return to the nass
- Similar cases: if his ijtihad differs with what is known by the senses, he also leaves it; 
	- Ex: someone makes ijtihad about the time of prayer and prays, but thereafter it becomes clear that he was wrong - he repeats the prayer
- Or if he erred in assessing the reality
	- Ex: He rules that zayd killed amr, but the Amr appears alive
- However, if he simply changes his fatwa (for himself), that necessitates updating actions based on that change - but what has passed has passed
	- Ex: He believed that a khul does not count towards the number of permitted divorces, but now believes it does, and that would not create a case where his wife has reached the limit of her divorces - he must release her


### 4.1.4.5 Can a scholar follow the opinion of another

| No. | Description | Held by | Evidences |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Permissible | Imam Ahmad, Ishaq ibn Rahawayh, Sufyan al-Thawri, most of the scholars of Iraq |  |
| 2 | Permissilbe - to follow the one more knowledgeable | Muhammad ibn Hasan |  |
| 3 | Impermissible in areas where he can make ijtihad| Al-Qadi Abu Bakr al-Balqini, Ibn Rashiq | Taqlid is reaching a hukm with no hujjah. But just as the mujtahid cant rule without a hujjah, he cant resort to another scholars statement because that is following a hukm with no hujjah |
