[Pages 485 - 535 - vol 1 printed book]
Issues:
1. Section 1: Clarifying what is meant by ijma
	- Definition: The agreement of the ummah of Muhammad (or its scholars) - for any length of time - on a ruling among the rulings of shari'ah
	- Q: How could we imagine it occuring, despite the differences in the ummah geographically and intellectually. A: Its has occurred on many issues, notably the obligation of the five pillars
	- Q: How could it be ascertained? A: Its possible for those who are present to express agreement and those who are absent to have it relayed
	- Q: Affirming its evidenciary status against those who deny it
		1. Quran (Al Nisa - 115) - this ayah was used by al-shafi'i, but its not sareehah. the zhahir mu'awwal cannot be used as a hujjah in qat'eyyaat (Dr. Zuhayli: Tawil is diverting a phrase from its apparent meaning to another one that is not apparent, with the possibility ??? ta'weel must have an evidence that necessitates it, because the essential state is the lack of a tawil, and the obligation is to act on the zhahir)
		2. Sunnah: 
			3. "My ummah will not agree on a mistake (khata')", (Not found with this wording)
			4. "My ummah will not agree on misguidance (dalalah)"
			5. "I asked Allah that my ummah not agree on misguidance and he granted me that" (Ahmad)
			- Although all of these are ahad, they can be considered as mutawatir lafdhe
			- Doubt: Even if these narrations are tawatur lafdhee, they are still not sareehah in affirming ijma (which is necessary for attainment of certain knowledge)
			- Response: 
				- What is known from the narrations is the divine protection (ismah) of the ummah from mistakes and misguidance. 
				- If they were to reach consensus on something false, they would have agreed on a mistake which opposes the meaning of the narrations. 
				- In addition, Allah informed about them that they command the good and forbid the evil. 
				- In addition to the statement of the prophet, "The victorious group is what I follow and my companions"
				- Following them cannot be achieved in a mistake - if they had agreed on a mistake victoriousness would be impossible
			- Doubt: Its not correct to limit the meaning of 'ummah' to only those alive in a single age - it should include all of those who have believed until the end of time - at which point, ijma has no benefit.
			- Response: Its not permissible to define the intent of these narrations to include all those who believe, because at that point ijma would only benefit on the day of judgement, when there is no need for it.
		3. Custom and Practice: We know from practice the impossibility of a group of scholars (firmly grounded in knowledge) - whose number reach the amount at which it would be impossible for them to agree on a lie - agreeing on hukm which is mistaken, while none of them dissent.
			* Doubt: Didnt the Jews agree on the falseness of the prophethood of Isa and Muhammad? Cant ijma occur based on uncertainty (zhann) and evidence of whim (tawahhamu daleelin)?
			* Response: History says there will always be someone amongst them to testify to the incorrectness, or some of those who agreed go back on their opinion - saying that they and others were wrong
			* Doubt: Even if we assume that what was agreed upon is true, where is the proof that they must be followed?
			* Response: Yes, they must be followed because they are certain that what they have agreed on is Allahs hukm in that matter for everyone, and that they are conveying that
1. Section 2: On the pillars of ijma
	1. Pillar 1: Those who have agreed
		- Definition: 1) All of those capable of clarifying Allah's hukm on the issue for which a ruling is sought 2) from the ummah of Muhammad 3) in that age. So that includes every mujtahid who knows the usul and the furoo of the shariah. This excludes the children, the insane, those not qualified to offer an opinion
		2. Issue: is the statement of an usuli, mufassir, muhaddith or nahwi considered?
			- Op 1: No, their position is not considered
			- Op 2: Everyone is considered that has memorized the furu'
			- Correct Op: Anyone capable of examining the situation by presented his memorization of its proofs or by taking those proofs from their sources, and validating what are valid and invalid among those proofs - their opinion must be considered in the ijma. This will include the usuli, but not the muhadith or mufassir
		1. Issue: Are the fasiq and the mubtadi (whose bidah doesnt remove him from islam) included? Examples: The Qadariyyah, The Khawarij, The Rafidah
			- Op 1: No, the are not considered, because they have no basis to stand on, due to making takfir of those from whom we take the religion (Malik)
			- Op 2: Yes, they are part of the ummah and they are capable of analyzing the situation (al-nazhr fil waqiah) so they must make ijtihad and its not allowed for them to make taqlid of another. Their fisq does not negate their knowledge (Ghazali, Shirazi, Juwayni)
		1. Issue: The ijma of other than the sahaba
			1. Op: The ijma of the sahaba (Op 2: and the tabieen) is not considered.
			2. Correct Op: No, it is not restricted. The three evidences given do not support that. The tabieen constituted the entire ummah for certain issues which the sahaba did not discuss.
		2. Issue: The ijma of the majority with the differing of the minority is not a hujjah
			1. Op: Only if the dissenting group reaches the number of tawatur, it prevents ijma from being reached.
			2. Correct Op: The proof of ijma is when the entire ummah agrees and any minority is part of the ummah
		3. Issue: The ijma of the people of madinah
			- Op: Some scholars such as Al Ghazali attritbuted to Imam Malik an opinion that the ijma is only considered for the people of madinah
			- Correct: This is an incorrect attribution. There are some statements of Imam Malik that indicate if there was an issue of agreement in Madinah, it was not permissible for someone to differ with that and there were some 48 issues is his Muwatta that depended on that. But his students differed regarding how to interpret that principle. (See footnotes in 509-510)
		1. Issue: The ijma of a people whose number is less than the number for tawatur
			- Op: Any group less than those required for tawatur cannot conclude ijma
			- Correct opinion:
				- If affirming ijma based on naql - then tawatur required
				- If affirming ijma based on custom - then such a group is not protected from being mistaken
		1. Issue: There is no evidence in the ijma of other than the sahabah
			- Op (Zhahiriyyah): There is no hujjah in the ijma of other than the sahabah
			- Correct Op: All of the evidences cited regarding the correctness of ijma, are not restricted to the sahabah
			- Doubt: The ayah and hadith cited only included the people of iman at the time the revelation came and when the statement was made
			- Response: That position would necessitate the impossibility of ijma after any of the sahabah died after the death of the prophet, or after the statement was made, or after the ayah was revealed. But no one says that.
	1. Pillar 2: The ijma itself
		1. Issue: It is not a condition for ijma, the ending of the generation (with the death of all those who agreed)
			- Doubt: As long as the people of ijma are still alive, its possible for them to retract their opinion
			- Response: 
				- All of them cannot retract their opinion (forming a second ijma) because that would necessitate that one of the two ijmas would be false. 
				- The retraction of some of them is a mistake certainly, because after an ijma has been concluded, the person who would retract is bound by that ijma
			- Doubt: How could you claim impermissibility of retracting when the ijma hasnt concluded - the ijma is only concluded when the generation passes away
			- Response: An ijma could be realized at a certain moment, but its not a condition for its presence that it remain. Futhermore, necessitating a generation passing away will make ijma impossible. There will always be a new mujtahid whose opinion would need to be considered.
			- <Two doubts raised by the other side>
		1. Issue: If some of the sahabah give a fatwa and the rest are silent
			1. Op 1 (Shafi, Maliki): No, ijma is not concluded with the silence of some. Agreement is only a possible meaning of their silence. If there is no agreement, there is no ijma.
			2. Op 2 (Abu Hanifah): Yes, it is ijma, but with conditions.
			- Doubt:
			- Response: Op 2 would necessitate that if some of the ummah gave fatwa on a situation which did not occur to another part of the ummah, it would be prohibited for them to differ
		1. Issue: Concluding an ijma on ijtihad and qiyas
			- Op 1 (majority): Yes this is valid - its not logically impossible for the people to agree one something that is not certain, such as the fasting based on two witnesses
1. Section 3: The ruling on ijma
	1. Issue: If they agreed on two opinions, it is haraam to establish a third
		- Op1: Yes, because if a thirda opinion were to be established sometime later it would necessitate that the ummah "lost" the evidence of that opinion, and were mistaken by leaving it for that time (until the third opinion was established). But we have already affirmed the divine protection for the ummah against mistakes with certain evidences, so anything would lead to it must be impossible on its own
	1. Issue: If the tabieen agree on one of the two opinions of the sahaba, the other opinion doesnt become abandoned to the extent that someone inclining to that opinion would be breaking ijma
		1. Op 1: Yes, agreement of the tabi'een on one of two opinions from the sahaba constitutes and ijma (Shafi'i, Karkhi, some of the Hanafis, Mutazilah)
		2. Op 2: No, it does not constitute ijma. Proof: The tabieen and those who agreed with them among the sahabah aren't the "entire ummah". There was a group of sahabah that differed with them - and the death of that second group doesnt mean its not allowed to return to their opinion. The tabieen would only be the entire ummah on an issue where the sahabah never offered an opinion.
	2. Issue: What if there is general agreement with the exception of one or two?
		1. Op 1 (Correct) that is not ijma. Whether the second opinion is many or few, its presence negates ijma
	3. Issue: If they differed into two opinions, and then agreed on one
		1. Op 1 (Correct) yes, this is ijma and after this, holding on to the first position (with two valid opinions) would not be permissible
		2. Op 2: this is not ijma.
	4.  Issue: If the sahaba agreed on an issue and then later one of them remembered a hadith - if they retract the ijma, it would show that it was a mistake. and if they persist on it, it would entail not following the report without any evidence.
		1. Op 1: This is impossible - the divine protection of the ummah from agreeing on a mistake, protects from agreeing on something in opposition to a report, and protects the narrator from forgetting. In the face of a report two things could occur for them to persist in the ijma or retract. If they persist, it shows that the report is not acted upon (the people of ijma believe the narrator is mistaken or that the report is abrogated). It would be impossible for them to retract.
	5. Issue: conveying ijma through a solitary report.
		1. Op: Ijma cannot be conveyed through a solitary report. Footnotes: Because an issue of ijma leads to certain knowledge and certain knowledge could not be obtained through a solitary report. A solitary report of ijma **could** necessitate action (like a prophetic hadith or non mutawatir recitation) but not lead to certain knowledge
	6. Issue: taking the least of what is said is not sticking with ijma
		1. Ex: Scholars differed about the diyyah of a jew: same as muslim, 1/2, 1/3. Taking the opinion of 1/3 would not be following ijma
