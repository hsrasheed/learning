# Practical Stats for Data Scientists

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Estimates of Location

* Mean - The sum of all values divided by the number of values.
* Weighted mean - The sum of all values times a weight divided by the sum of the weights.
* Median - The value such that one-half of the data lies above and below.
* Percentile - The value such that P percent of the data lies below.
* Weighted median - The value such that one-half of the sum of the weights lies above and below the sorted data.
* Trimmed mean - The average of all values after dropping a fixed number of extreme values.
* Robust - Not sensitive to extreme values.
* Outlier - A data value that is very different from most of the data.

### Estimates of Variability

* Deviations - The difference between the observed values and the estimate of location.
* Variance - The sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by n – 1 where n is the number of data values.
* Standard deviation - The square root of the variance.
* Mean absolute deviation - The mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the mean.
* Median absolute deviation from the median - The median of the absolute values of the deviations from the median.
* Range - The difference between the largest and the smallest value in a data set.
* Order statistics - Metrics based on the data values sorted from smallest to biggest.
* Percentile - The value such that P percent of the values take on this value or less and (100–P) percent take on this value or more.
* Interquartile range - The difference between the 75th percentile and the 25th percentile.
